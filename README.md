# CMPSC 481 - Course Presentation

* Point value: 250 pts. (25% of course grade)
* Assigned: 9 April 2020
* Due: 27 April 2020

## Objective

To revisit and understand your team's work in the context of a three project semester.

## Description

Though this presentation defines specific areas of discussion for your team, think of this as an opportunity to tell a story about how your team and its members have grown as individual contributors and team players. The word "narrative" has been associated with this presentation assignment in several conversations -- think about how you can tell your team's _narrative_.

Some opportunities for creative embellishment include (but might not be limited to):

* A team logo
* A team slogan/tagline
* A team slide template

As has been the hope all semester, by this point your team should have a good sense of its identity: what each team member brings to the group, how they've grown, and how the team has changed over the last three months.

Of course, we can't ignore how the transition to remote work has affected all of us -- if there are particular narrative points which highlight or discuss this change, those are expected and welcome!

## Goals

* To reflect on and assess your work as an independent, autonomous software development team
* To assemble a professional portfolio of work to understand progress, lessons learned
* To conduct a meaningful `post mortem` analysis of individual and team performance

If you do not wish your voice or likeness to be included in the recording, please let the instructor know and we can make arrangements _not_ to record the presentation or have another team member read the text of your contribution.

## Evaluation

The points you earn for this presentation will come from a combination of:

* The quality of your group's reflection and presentation
* The overall quality of your interaction with and contribution to your chosen project
* Comments from peers and external reviewers using feedback forms to be provided at the time of the presentation

### Feedback forms

Keep in mind that your instructor has been collecting data on your performance over the course of the semester. This cumulative information will be used to evaluate your performance and will constitute `50 points` of your final participation grade (the same as other modules). There will be one additional survey issued at the time of your team's presentation which will be due by `4 May 2020`. This survey will be distributed via Slack using your individual team channels.

## Turning in the assignment

### Writing

All reports should be turned in using Markdown files extant in the `writing` directory of this repository. As stipulated in the Syllabus [in the course-materials repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-481-spring-2020/course-materials), the writer should spearhead the effort. However, this does not mean that they alone should complete it. These reports require input and contribution from the entire group.

### Surveys

This survey will be distributed to you via our course's [Slack channel](http://cmpsc-481-sp-2020.slack.com) as we near the end of the module.
